%h2 Expectations for developer mentors ("journey(wo)men")
%p Goal: level up, mentor, increase communication & leadership skills, learn about best practices from other companies, earn rewards.
%p Pairing model.
%p As much explanation / "talk aloud" as makes sense.
%p At least being able to answer, "What are you doing?"
%p Provide feedback via student and or coordinator (Yong) or online issue tracker.
%p Let the student drive when appropriate (eg. committing, pushing, deploying, closing issue, etc)
%p Consider delegating an investigative task between sessions (eg. what's the best library for doing x?)
%p Meaningful pairing experience (eg. two hours spent banging against a subtle/elusive bug)
%p Use "lower priority" projects as a vehicle for the pairing (eg cloud migrations, etc)
